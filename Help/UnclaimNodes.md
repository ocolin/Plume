# Claim and Unclaim nodes- API

## Claim Gateway

After creating the Wifi Network, the next step is to claim the Gateway, which may be an ISP Gateway or a Plume pod. A technician may use this API call on a service portal.

Using Plume mobile App, the node may be claimed by the customer via:

- a QR scanner built into the Plume mobile App.
- entering a nodeId (usually serial number)
- If the node includes a BLE radio, the Plume mobile App will claim it via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) if the customer is logged in and the hardware is powered on.

- License Note: This API call increases the number of Plume licenses consumed by the ISP

## Additional nodes can be claimed:

- during the onboarding flow using the mobile app
- after onboarding using Add nodes button in the mobile app.
- using Frontline by a technician
- using API by a technician

## Validations

- Admin authorization token or user authorization token
- CustomerID in the URL must be a customer within the administrative scope of the user token provided for Authorization
- LocationID must exist and must be within the administrative scope of the user token provided in Header Authorization
- The serial number must be already provisioned and configured in the Plume Cloud inventory
- The serial number must not be already claimed at another customer location

## Request

The claim API call is the same for both Gateways and Extenders.

## HTTP Error Codes and Reasons:

| Code | Response |
| ---- | -------- |
| HTTP 200: No Content.	| Valid serial number but zero new claimed nodes for this location. I.e., this node is already claimed. |
| HTTP 401: Authorization required.	| Authorization Header failed the security check due to being missing or expired, or the user does not have the appropriate security context to execute this API on this group. |
| HTTP 404: Unable to find Node	| Unable to find Node with the serial number or location id. |
| HTTP 409: Already owned	| Another customer owns the node. |
| HTTP 422: Input validation failed.| 	Claiming request exceeded numPodsAuthorized (=leaf pods), accountId+partnerId not unique, and/or monitorMode=true. |
| HTTP 500: Internal server error. | Internal server error. Inventory service unreachable. |
| HTTP 503: Service unavailable	| Some error occurs after nodes are successfully claimed on location. |


## Unclaim nodes

To get a Plume Extender ready to be sent in for replacement via RMA, it must be unclaimed from the customer account and location.  This step occurs when the customer removes a Plume Extender from the Plume Mobile App or support removes the Extender using Frontline. A technician may alternatively complete this action on behalf of the customer using this API from a service portal. The following API call is used to achieve this process.

## Validations:

- Admin authorization token or user authorization token
- Customer ID in the URL must be a customer within administrative scope of user token provided for Authorization
- Location ID must exist and must be within the administrative scope of user token provided in Header Authorization
