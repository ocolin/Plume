# Update Plume Customer AccountID to reflect ISP CRM Account ID changes - API

The AccountID field, which is part of the customer object is auto-filled with a UUID (universally unique identifier) as a result of the creation step detailed in the previous step.

The primary purpose of the AccountID is to establish a relationship between an existing ISPâ€™s customer database and the plume customer database. Notably, the Plume Cloud enforces that the combination of partnerId and accountId is unique such that an ISP cannot create a duplicate Plume Cloud customer account for a single ISP customer account.

The following API Endpoint is used to update the AccountID using the customerID which was returned in the customer creation step.

## Validation:
- Admin authorization token.
- CustomerID in the URL path is a valid existing customer
- AccountId is unique within the Plume Cloud for accounts with the corresponding partnerId value
